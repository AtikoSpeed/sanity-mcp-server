# TODO

- Comprehensive integration tests for mutations
- Don't list all of release content in the initialContext - just the names
- Get more coverage on the integration tests for other workflows
- âœ… Optimize testing strategy with categorized integration tests

## Code Quality Improvements (Prioritized)

1. âœ… Extract smaller functions from editDocument in controllers/actions.ts
2. âœ… Extract smaller functions from createDocumentVersion in controllers/actions.ts
3. âœ… Extract smaller functions from modifyDocuments in controllers/mutate.ts
4. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/releases.ts, focusing on addDocumentToRelease and removeDocumentFromRelease
5. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/actions.ts, focusing on createDocument and deleteDocument
6. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/releases.ts for createRelease function
7. âœ… Add unit tests for utility functions in documentHelpers.ts
8. âœ… Replace `any` types with more specific types across core controller files
9. âœ… Improve type safety across codebase, particularly for Sanity client operations
10. ðŸ”„ Reduce complexity in embeddings.ts, particularly in semanticSearch function
11. ðŸ†• Take a more aggressive approach to type safety improvements (no backward compatibility needed):
    - Completely eliminate remaining `any` types in non-test code
    - Redesign function signatures for improved semantics and type safety
    - Refactor parameter orders to be more intuitive without concern for existing consumers
    - Remove conditional handling of test vs. production environments
    - Consider using stricter TypeScript compiler options
12. Add constants for commonly duplicated string literals (especially in test files)
13. Refactor remaining functions with high cognitive complexity, especially in:
    - controllers/embeddings.ts (listEmbeddingsIndices, semanticSearch)
    - controllers/groq.ts
    - controllers/schema.ts (checkForReferences)
    - utils/documentHelpers.ts (applyPatchOperations)
    - utils/portableText.ts

## Tooling & Process Improvements

- Set up ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript (including complexity analysis rules)
- Add GitHub Action for linting
- Improve CI pipeline
- Add code coverage reporting

## Error Handling

- âœ… Extract error handling to a reusable createErrorResponse function (for consistency)
- âœ… Apply this across controllers

## Technical Debt

- Move from TS-Node to a bundled dist
- Refactor tests to be more maintaneous and use common setup functions
- Evaluate moving to OpenAPI spec for route definition
- âœ… Address TypeScript type conflicts with @sanity/client types

## Done
- âœ… Integration test for release document workflow
- âœ… Fix TypeScript configuration for test files
- âœ… Add pre-release hook for integration tests
- âœ… Add pre-commit hook for running integration tests and type checking
- âœ… Add integration test for array parameter deserialization
- âœ… Check that we don't have errors serializing arrays over the protocol
- âœ… Fix TypeScript errors in test files
- âœ… Fix the schema command for single types
- âœ… Update single document endpoints with pluralized versions - check if union types actually work (addDocumentToRelease is a good one, also getDocument). First see if we want to have separate verbs for single and plural versions or use union types. API design question.
- âœ… Remove `modifyPortableTextField` functionality (complex implementation with high cognitive complexity)
- âœ… Refactor `editDocument` and `createDocumentVersion` in `controllers/actions.ts`
- âœ… Extract repeated patterns in `actions.ts` to shared utility functions
- âœ… Add unit tests for utility functions in documentHelpers.ts

# TODO List for Sanity MCP Server

## High Priority

1. **Unify type definitions across controllers and tools**
   - Current issue: Type definitions are duplicated between tools and controllers
   - Parameters sometimes marked as optional in tool definitions but required in implementation
   - Need to create shared interfaces and types that can be used consistently
   - Ensure the schema accurately reflects what's actually required in function calls
   - Consider using TypeScript's utility types to derive tool parameter schemas from controller function signatures

## Medium Priority

1. **Improve error handling**
   - Add better error messages and consistent error format
   - Add validation for all parameters

2. **Update logger usage across all files**
   - Replace all remaining console.log/error calls with the central logger

3. **Improve test coverage**
   - Add more tests for edge cases
   - Fix integration tests for the MCP server

## Nice to Have

1. **Documentation improvements**
   - Add more examples for each tool
   - Better describe parameters and return values
