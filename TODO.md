# TODO

- Run a code smell test on the repo and see what we should refactor. The huge tools.js file is a good candidate for refactoring. If we do that the new files should be paired 1:1 with the controllers that they describe.

- Don't list all of release content in the initialContext - just the names
- Get more coverage on the integration tests for other workflows

## Code Quality Improvements (Prioritized)

1. âœ… Extract smaller functions from editDocument in controllers/actions.ts
2. âœ… Extract smaller functions from createDocumentVersion in controllers/actions.ts
3. âœ… Extract smaller functions from modifyDocuments in controllers/mutate.ts
4. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/releases.ts, focusing on addDocumentToRelease and removeDocumentFromRelease
5. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/actions.ts, focusing on createDocument and deleteDocument
6. âœ… Reduce complexity in controllers/releases.ts for createRelease function
7. âœ… Add unit tests for utility functions in documentHelpers.ts

8. ðŸ”„ Replace `any` types with more specific types across core controller files
9. ðŸ”„ Reduce complexity in embeddings.ts, particularly in semanticSearch function

10. Add constants for commonly duplicated string literals (especially in test files)
11. Refactor remaining functions with high cognitive complexity, especially in:
    - controllers/embeddings.ts (listEmbeddingsIndices, semanticSearch)
    - controllers/groq.ts
    - controllers/schema.ts (checkForReferences)
    - utils/documentHelpers.ts (applyPatchOperations)
    - utils/portableText.ts

## Tooling & Process Improvements

- Set up ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript (including complexity analysis rules)
- Add GitHub Action for linting
- Improve CI pipeline
- Add code coverage reporting

## Error Handling

- Extract error handling to a reusable createErrorResponse function (for consistency)
- Apply this across controllers

## Technical Debt

- Move from TS-Node to a bundled dist
- Refactor tests to be more maintaneous and use common setup functions
- Evaluate moving to OpenAPI spec for route definition

## Done
- âœ… Integration test for release document workflow
- âœ… Fix TypeScript configuration for test files
- âœ… Add pre-release hook for integration tests
- âœ… Add pre-commit hook for running integration tests and type checking
- âœ… Add integration test for array parameter deserialization
- âœ… Check that we don't have errors serializing arrays over the protocol
- âœ… Fix TypeScript errors in test files
- âœ… Fix the schema command for single types
- âœ… Update single document endpoints with pluralized versions - check if union types actually work (addDocumentToRelease is a good one, also getDocument). First see if we want to have separate verbs for single and plural versions or use union types. API design question.
- âœ… Remove `modifyPortableTextField` functionality (complex implementation with high cognitive complexity)
- âœ… Refactor `editDocument` and `createDocumentVersion` in `controllers/actions.ts`
- âœ… Extract repeated patterns in `actions.ts` to shared utility functions
- âœ… Add unit tests for utility functions in documentHelpers.ts
