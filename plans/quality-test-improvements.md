# Quality Test Improvements Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to fix the current test failures and TypeScript errors in the quality scripts and tests. The goal is to ensure all unit and integration tests pass successfully, and all TypeScript errors are resolved.

## 1. Integration Test Fixes

### Release Limit Issues

The primary issue affecting integration tests is the "active release count exceeds the limit of 10" error. This occurs because:

- Previous test runs may have created releases but failed to clean them up properly
- We need to implement better cleanup mechanisms for test releases
- We may need to implement a pre-test cleanup step to remove existing releases

#### Action Items:

1. Create a utility script to clean up test releases before running tests
2. Modify release-document-workflow.test.ts to:
   - Add better error handling for release creation
   - Ensure cleanup occurs even when tests fail
   - Add a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for release operations
3. Update array-parameter-deserialization.test.ts with similar improvements

## 2. TypeScript Error Fixes

### Quality Scripts Fixes

The TypeScript errors appear to be primarily in the new quality scripts and their tests:

#### analyze-complexity.js (Line 162)

- Fix the type mismatch for pushing to the complexityData.functions array
- Properly type the complexityData.functions array to accept the function info object

#### collect-test-results.js (Line 91)

- Fix the execSync options typing issue by ensuring the encoding is a valid BufferEncoding
- Fix the stdio type to be a valid StdioOptions

#### complexity-check.test.js

- Fix the mock implementation issues by using the correct mocking approach for fs, path, and execSync
- Ensure the mock implementation is compatible with the TypeScript type system

#### diagnose-metrics.test.js

- Fix the bigint type errors in the file stats mock by using BigInt for the numeric values

#### metrics-functions.test.js

- Fix undefined function errors by correctly importing or defining the missing functions
- Fix the toBe assertion calls with incorrect parameters

## 3. Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Integration Tests**
   - Create a release cleanup utility script 
   - Update the integration tests to use the cleanup utility
   - Add retry mechanisms for release operations

2. **Fix TypeScript Errors in Test Files First**
   - Fix mocking approach in test files
   - Update test assertions to match TypeScript expectations

3. **Fix TypeScript Errors in Script Files**
   - Fix type issues in analyze-complexity.js
   - Fix type issues in collect-test-results.js

4. **Validate All Fixes**
   - Run typecheck:all to ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
   - Run test:unit to verify unit tests pass
   - Run test:integration to verify integration tests pass

## 4. Dependency Changes

We may need to update the following dependencies or configurations:

- Update the Jest/Vitest mock implementation approach for compatibility with TypeScript
- Update tsconfig.test.json to properly handle JS test files with TypeScript
- Consider migrating test files from JS to TS to improve type safety

## 5. Success Criteria

- All TypeScript errors are resolved (npm run typecheck:all passes with no errors)
- All unit tests pass (npm run test:unit passes with no failures)
- All integration tests pass (npm run test:integration passes with no failures)
- Code coverage is maintained or improved
