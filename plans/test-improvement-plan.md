# Test Improvement Plan

## Background
The current codebase has several testing issues that need to be addressed:
1. TypeScript errors in test files
2. ESLint configuration problems, particularly with the sonarjs/cognitive-complexity rule
3. Unit tests not properly running
4. Integration tests with potential failures
5. Lack of comprehensive test documentation

This plan outlines the steps to improve the test suite and ensure all tests are passing successfully.

## Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Configuration and Errors

### Issues Identified
- Module import errors in quality-validation.test.ts and complexity-check.test.js
- TypeScript configuration may need adjustments for test files

### Action Plan
1. Fix the import statements in test/unit/quality-validation.test.ts
   - Modify the import path for validateAllMetrics to find the correct module
   - Ensure the scripts/quality directory exists and contains the required files

2. Fix the import statements in test/unit/quality/complexity-check.test.js
   - Update the import path for complexity-check.js
   - Consider converting the test to TypeScript if appropriate

3. Run typecheck:all and address all remaining TypeScript errors
   - Fix type-related errors in test files
   - Update TypeScript configuration if needed

4. Ensure consistent TypeScript configuration across all test suites
   - Review tsconfig.test.json to ensure it's properly configured
   - Make sure all test files are included in the TypeScript configuration

## Phase 2: Resolve ESLint Issues

### Issues Identified
- sonarjs/cognitive-complexity rule not found in ESLint configuration
- Unused variables and imports throughout the codebase
- Functions with high complexity scores

### Action Plan
1. Fix sonarjs/cognitive-complexity configuration in .eslintrc.json
   - Ensure the sonarjs plugin is properly installed and configured
   - Verify the rule is correctly set up in the ESLint configuration

2. Address unused variables and imports across the codebase
   - Use the --fix option with ESLint where possible
   - Manually address remaining issues

3. Refactor functions with high complexity scores
   - Identify functions with complexity above 10
   - Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable pieces
   - Update tests to reflect refactored code

4. Create repeatable linting process with automatic fixes where possible
   - Add pre-commit hook for linting
   - Document common linting issues and how to fix them

## Phase 3: Unit Test Improvements

### Issues Identified
- Unit tests not being found or not running properly
- Potential test failures in existing unit tests
- Missing test coverage for some controllers and utilities

### Action Plan
1. Fix unit test directory structure and ensure tests are discovered
   - Verify the test pattern in Vitest configuration
   - Make sure test files follow the naming convention

2. Fix existing unit test failures
   - Run individual test files to identify specific failures
   - Fix assertion errors and update test expectations

3. Add test coverage for controllers without sufficient tests
   - Identify controllers with low coverage
   - Add new tests for critical functionality

4. Implement tests for core utility functions
   - Ensure all utility functions have proper test coverage
   - Add edge case testing for critical utilities

## Phase 4: Integration Test Enhancements

### Issues Identified
- Potential failures in integration tests
- Missing tests for some workflows
- Slow-running integration tests

### Action Plan
1. Fix critical integration test failures
   - Run critical tests and identify failures
   - Address issues with test setup or assertions

2. Ensure core document operations tests are passing
   - Run test:core and fix any failures
   - Improve reliability of document operation tests

3. Add integration tests for missing workflows
   - Identify gaps in test coverage for workflows
   - Add new tests to cover these workflows

4. Optimize slow-running integration tests
   - Identify bottlenecks in integration tests
   - Improve test setup and teardown to reduce execution time
   - Consider parallelization where appropriate

## Phase 5: Testing Documentation

### Issues Identified
- Lack of clear documentation for test categories
- Missing guidelines for writing effective tests
- Unclear test environment requirements

### Action Plan
1. Document test categories and their intended use cases
   - Create documentation for unit, controller, and integration tests
   - Clarify when to use each test category

2. Create guide for writing effective tests
   - Document best practices for test structure
   - Provide examples of good test patterns

3. Document test environment setup requirements
   - Clarify environment variables needed for tests
   - Document external dependencies required for testing

4. Establish clear criteria for test quality
   - Define coverage targets for different code areas
   - Set guidelines for test assertions and edge cases
