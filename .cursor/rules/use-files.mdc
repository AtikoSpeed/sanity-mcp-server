- Use [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) to track progress.
- Ask before making large changes to [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md)
- Always work in feature branches. Ask before merging.
- Update changelog continuously, but mark a release when we tag a new one
- Use the `npm run quality:report` feature before creating a tag to see how we're trending. We want to track date, tslint errors (of different kinds), cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity and test coverage as we go. Record it as NDJSON in ./scripts/quality/quality-tag-checkpoint.ndjson
